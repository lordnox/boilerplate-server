## Intro

These files are meant to help you quickly get up and running using Grunt with Express, with livereload, automatic app server reboots, automatic testing, and a [SASS-based flexible responsive grid](https://github.com/appleYaks/responsive-sass-grid) for rapid development. Client-side libraries are retrieved with `bower`.

[This is an example](http://davidarvelo.com/e/workflow/) of what the project compiles to. Resize the browser to see it at different media query breakpoints.

**Note:** It's important that you have the proper npm libraries globally installed:

```bash
$ npm install -g yo node-inspector nodemon grunt-cli bower karma istanbul
```

After installing the global dependencies above, run:

```bash
$ cd grunt-express-workflow
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt server
```

And you're ready to go!

## Yeoman strong

This scaffold is based off of the default Yeoman scaffold, started with

`$ yo webapp`

I've built on it from that initial state.

## SASS/Compass Example Files and Modules

The project has been outfitted with helpful SASS modules, including the [flexible responsive grid module](https://github.com/appleYaks/responsive-sass-grid). Examples of how you can leverage some of the power of SASS and Compass are shown throughout the `app/styles/` folder. The `app/images/sprites` folder is now special. You can create folders in it with images you wish to make into individual spritesheets using Compass' [sprite helpers](http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/spriting/). An example of this is in the project. The `relativeAssets` option in the `compass` grunt task has been changed to `false`, since `relativeAssets: true` produces [incorrect](https://gist.github.com/passy/5270050) [references](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/419) to sprites in the final CSS. Images are now referenced relative to the definitions in the root file `compass.rb`.

## Testing

Karma, Istanbul, and Mocha run automated tests and coverage for the frontend and backend. This happens when development files or test files are changed during a `grunt server` run, or when the `grunt test` command is run on the command line. More information can be found in [this blog post](http://arvelocity.com/2013/07/02/running-an-express-server-with-grunt-and-yeoman-part-3/).

## "But how do I use this? Why did you make this?"

This and more in the companion [blog](http://arvelocity.com/2013/05/30/running-an-express-server-with-grunt-and-yeoman-part-2/) [posts](http://arvelocity.com/2013/07/02/running-an-express-server-with-grunt-and-yeoman-part-3/) to this repository.

### Special Notes:

1. If you want to `grunt build` for production with Handlebars in your project, you'll need to change the Handlebars runtime library code from the initial `var Handlebars = {};` to `this.Handlebars = {};` so that it'll be attached to the `window` object and found by RequireJS modules. It seems this is being fixed upstream with the Handlebars developers at the time of this writing.

2. If you want to test your media queries in old IE with `respond.js`, be sure to modify your `Gruntfile.js` to switch your `compass:server` options from `debugInfo: true` to `debugInfo: false`. This removes Compass' ability to inject certain media queries into your CSS, which would make it easier for you to debug your styles in modern browser debuggers, but confuse the logic of `respond.js`.
